## Get started

Edirom-Online Backend is the backend for the [Edirom-Online](https://github.com/Edirom/Edirom-Online) software.  It is a web application written in XQuery, and is designed for deployment in [eXist-db]. Its development is closely connected to the [Edirom-Online Frontend](https://github.com/Edirom/Edirom-Online-Frontend) and the Edirom-Online as a whole. Please see the GitHub repository for [Edirom-Online](https://github.com/Edirom/Edirom-Online) for planning information, issue listings, and further documentation.

  * also see [exist-db via Docker]
  * `docker run -it -d -p 8080:8080 -p 8443:8443 --name exist stadlerpeter/existdb:6` (see stadlerpeter/existdb)
  * open in browser: `http://localhost:8080` (Note: there were problems opening this in Safari)
  * Login with "admin:[empty]"
* build and deploy **xar of Edirom-Online Backend**
  * also see [building locally] above
  * at `http://localhost:8080/exist/apps/dashboard/admin#` (signed-in) go to "Package Manager" then "Upload" and select the xar file which (supposed above build-method was used) was built at `/PATH_TO_LOCAL_EDIROM_REPO/build-xar/Edirom-Online-Backend-1.1.0-[TIMESTAMP].xar`
* build and deploy **xar of Edirom-Online Frontend**
  * for building the frontend module please see https://github.com/Edirom/Edirom-Online-Frontend
  * at `http://localhost:8080/exist/apps/dashboard/admin#` (signed-in) go to "Package Manager" then "Upload" and select the xar file which (supposed above build-method was used) was built at `/PATH_TO_LOCAL_EDIROM_REPO/build-xar/Edirom-Online-Frontend-1.1.0-[TIMESTAMP].xar`
* build **xar of sample data** for deploying at exist-db
  * also see [building sample data]
